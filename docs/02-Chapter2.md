# Didgeridoo 

## Overview

## History and Significance
The didgeridoo, or yidaki, is an ancient wind instrument believed to have originated among the indigenous people of northern Australia over 40,000 years ago [@harris]. This instrument is traditionally used for cermonial functions and also for recreational and entertainment purposes. Ramin Yazdanpanah is a modern didgeridoo musician who plays with the [Maharajah Flamenco Trio](https://www.mftrio.com/), a group that incorporates global sounds into their music.

## Science
@timbres sums up an article by @tarnopolsky and notes that skilled didgeridoo musicians can adjust their throat anatomy to produce a very wide range of [timbres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre). @fletcher provides a summary of the physics of this simple instrument. 

## Construction
The didgeridoo will be constructed from three PVC components seen in Figure \@ref(fig:construction): a reducing coupling (A), a pipe (B) , and a trap adapter (C and D). The length (L) of the pipe is variable and determines the key of the instrument. The mouthpiece is in two pieces. Part D will need to be threaded onto Part C. All other fittings should be pressed on until secure. No adhesives are used in this construction.

To begin, join the reducing coupling (A) to the pipe (B).

Next, join the pipe (B) to the trap adapter base (C).

Finally, join the trap adapter base (C) to the trap adapter nut (D) by carefully threading the nut onto the base.

Your PVC didgeridoo should now be fully assembled. Wipe down the trap adapter with an alcohol pad before attempting to play!

## Standard Form
While traditional hollow-branch didgeridoos are generally straight, the PVC didgeridoo can be created in many forms. The standard straight form is the simplest design with a single length of pipe connecting the mouthpiece to the flared bell (our reducing coupling) at the opposite end.

## Alternative Forms
Alternative forms can result in more compact, twisted variations. These forms require extensive cutting and the use of angled fittings. One example is presented here for inspiration. With these forms, students can create longer didgeridoos and deeper, more resonant notes while occupying minimal space. What new form can you create?

## Tuning
According to @tuning, the length of a didgeridoo for a particular desired frequency (also called the "key" of the didgeridoo) can be found using the formula $l = c/4f$ where $l$ is the length in meters, $c$ is the speed of sound in meters per second, and $f$ is the desired frequency in Hertz (or key). We'll do our calculations using the metric system so, as an example, let's find the length of a didgeridoo that will play in the key of E (82.41Hz). We can do this by solving for the equation $l = 344/(4*82.41)$. We use 344 m/s because that is the speed of sound in dry air at a temperature of 20 degrees C. Solving this gives us a didgeridoo length of $344/329.64$ or about 1.04 meters. It's good practice to start with a didgeridoo that is longer than needed and then you can cut and sand the PVC pipe to the desired length and key. See below for a data table of keys, frequencies (Hz), and estimated pipe lengths (mm). To estimate the key for a didgeridoo of a known length, solve the formula for $f$ instead to get $f = c/4l$ where $l$ is again the length of the didgeridoo in meters.

## Decoration
According to @harris, the didgeridoo may be decorated. Many designs are inspired by nature and traditional pigments contributed an array of earth-tone hues to the instrument. See Figure \@ref(fig:patternsA) for some examples.
