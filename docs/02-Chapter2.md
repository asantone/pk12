# Didgeridoo 

## Overview
TODO

## History and Significance

## Science
@timbres sums up an article by @tarnopolsky and notes that skilled didgeridoo musicians can adjust their throat anatomy to produce a very wide range of [timbres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre). @fletcher provides a summary of the physics of this simple instrument. 

## Construction
The didgeridoo will be constructed from three PVC components seen in Figure \@ref(fig:construction): a reducing coupling (A), a pipe (B) , and a trap adapter (C and D). The length (L) of the pipe is variable and determines the key of the instrument. The mouthpiece is in two pieces. Part D will need to be threaded onto Part C. All other fittings should be pressed on until secure. No adhesives are used in this construction.

To begin, join the reducing coupling (A) to the pipe (B).

Next, join the pipe (B) to the trap adapter base (C).

Finally, join the trap adapter base (C) to the trap adapter nut (D) by carefully threading the nut onto the base.

Your PVC didgeridoo should now be fully assembled. Wipe down the trap adapter with an alcohol pad before attempting to play!

## Standard Form
The didgeridoo can be created in many forms. The standard form, which is the focus of this activity, results in a simple straight form.

## Alternative Forms
Alternative forms can result in more compact, twisted variations. These forms require extensive cutting and the use of angled fittings. One example is presented here for inspiration. With these forms, students can create longer didgeridoos and deeper, more resonant notes while occupying minimal space.

## Tuning
According to @tuning, the length of a didgeridoo for a particular desired frequency (also called the "key" of the didgeridoo) can be found using the formula $l = c/4f$ where l is the length, c is the speed of sound, and f is the desired frequency (or key). We'll do our calculations using the metric system so, as an example, let's find the length of a didgeridoo that will play in the key of E (82.41Hz). We can do this by solving for the equation $l = 344/(4*82.41)$. We use 344 m/s because that is the speed of sound in dry air at a temperature of 20 degrees C. Solving this gives us a didgeridoo length of $344/329.64$ or about 1.04 meters. It's good practice to start with a didgeridoo that is longer than needed and then you can cut and sand the PVC pipe to the desired length and key. See below for a data table of keys, frequencies (Hz), and estimated pipe lengths (mm).
