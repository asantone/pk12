["index.html", "Didgeridata Introduction", " Didgeridata Adam Santone 2019-04-17 Introduction This activity guides groups of students through a brief study of the history and construction of either a didgeridoo, the worldâ€™s oldest wind instrument, or a paixiao, a chinese pan flute. Students will work with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and PVC-cutting tools to design and create a playable musical instrument which will be used by students to compose a custom song related to climate data such as atmospheric CO\\(_{2}\\) concentration or global temperature anomalies. In this way, the sonification of climate data will be accomplished with a student musical chorus. The activity will conclude with a group jam session with participants invited to provide percussion for the wind section. An attempt will be made to have expert musicians join the program via teleconference as a guest speaker to provide instruction and background information. "]
