["index.html", "Didgeridata Introduction", " Didgeridata Adam Santone 2019-04-16 Introduction This activity guides groups of students through a brief study of the history and construction of either a didgeridoo, the world’s oldest wind instrument, or a paixiao, a chinese pan flute. Students will work with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and PVC-cutting tools to design and create a playable musical instrument which will be used by students to compose a custom song related to climate data such as atmospheric CO\\(_{2}\\) concentration or global temperature anomalies. In this way, the sonification of climate data will be accomplished with a student musical chorus. The activity will conclude with a group jam session with participants invited to provide percussion for the wind section. An attempt will be made to have expert musicians join the program via teleconference as a guest speaker to provide instruction and background information. "],

The length (L) of the pipe is variable and determines the key of the instrument. The mouthpiece is in two pieces. Part D will need to be threaded onto Part C. All other fittings should be pressed on until secure. No adhesives are used in this construction. Figure 2.1: PVC didgeridoo construction 2.3 Standard Form The didgeridoo can be created in many forms. The standard form, which is the focus of this activity, results in a simple straight form. Figure 2.2: PVC didgeridoo; standard form 2.4 Alternative Forms Alternative forms can result in more compact, twisted variations. These forms require extensive cutting and the use of angled fittings. One example is presented here for inspiration. With these forms, students can create longer didgeridoos and deeper, more resonant notes while occupying minimal space.
