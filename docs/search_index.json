Students will work with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and PVC-cutting tools to design and create a playable musical instrument which will be used by students to compose a custom song related to climate data such as atmospheric CO\\(_{2}\\) concentration or global temperature anomalies. In this way, the sonification of climate data will be accomplished with a student musical chorus. The activity will conclude with a group jam session with participants invited to provide percussion for the wind section. An attempt will be made to have expert musicians join the program via teleconference as a guest speaker to provide instruction and background information. "],

This instrument is traditionally used for cermonial functions and also for recreational and entertainment purposes. Ramin Yazdanpanah is a modern didgeridoo musician who plays with the Maharajah Flamenco Trio, a group that incorporates global sounds into their music. Figure 2.1: Ramin Yazdanpanah of the Maharajah Flamenco Trio from the official video for “Dariya.” Roughcut Productions, 2017. 2.3 Science Hopkin (2005) sums up an article by Tarnopolsky et al. (2005) and notes that skilled didgeridoo musicians can adjust their throat anatomy to produce a very wide range of timbres. Fletcher (1996) provides a summary of the physics of this simple instrument. 2.4 Construction The didgeridoo will be constructed from three PVC components seen in Figure 2.2: a reducing coupling (A), a pipe (B) , and a trap adapter (C and D). The length (L) of the pipe is variable and determines the key of the instrument. The mouthpiece is in two pieces. Part D will need to be threaded onto Part C. All other fittings should be pressed on until secure. No adhesives are used in this construction. Figure 2.2: PVC didgeridoo construction To begin, join the reducing coupling (A) to the pipe (B). Figure 2.3: PVC didgeridoo construction, part A Next, join the pipe (B) to the trap adapter base (C). Figure 2.4: PVC didgeridoo construction, part B Finally, join the trap adapter base (C) to the trap adapter nut (D) by carefully threading the nut onto the base. Figure 2.5: PVC didgeridoo construction, part C Your PVC didgeridoo should now be fully assembled. Wipe down the trap adapter with an alcohol pad before attempting to play! 2.5 Standard Form While traditional hollow-branch didgeridoos are generally straight, the PVC didgeridoo can be created in many forms. The standard straight form is the simplest design with a single length of pipe connecting the mouthpiece to the flared bell (our reducing coupling) at the opposite end. Figure 2.6: PVC didgeridoo; standard form 2.6 Alternative Forms Alternative forms can result in more compact, twisted variations. These forms require extensive cutting and the use of angled fittings. One example is presented here for inspiration. With these forms, students can create longer didgeridoos and deeper, more resonant notes while occupying minimal space. What new form can you create? Figure 2.7: PVC didgeridoo; standard form 2.7 Tuning According to Didjshop (2016), the length of a didgeridoo for a particular desired frequency (also called the “key” of the didgeridoo) can be found using the formula \\(l = c/4f\\) where \\(l\\) is the length in meters, \\(c\\) is the speed of sound in meters per second, and \\(f\\) is the desired frequency in Hertz (or key). We’ll do our calculations using the metric system so, as an example, let’s find the length of a didgeridoo that will play in the key of E (82.41Hz). We can do this by solving for the equation \\(l = 344/(4*82.41)\\). We use 344 m/s because that is the speed of sound in dry air at a temperature of 20 degrees C. Solving this gives us a didgeridoo length of \\(344/329.64\\) or about 1.04 meters. It’s good practice to start with a didgeridoo that is longer than needed and then you can cut and sand the PVC pipe to the desired length and key. See below for a data table of keys, frequencies (Hz), and estimated pipe lengths (mm). To estimate the key for a didgeridoo of a known length, solve the formula for \\(f\\) instead to get \\(f = c/4l\\) where \\(l\\) is again the length of the didgeridoo in meters.

Many designs are inspired by nature and traditional pigments contributed an array of earth-tone hues to the instrument. See Figures 2.8 and 2.9 for some examples. Figure 2.8: Didgeridoo decorations.
